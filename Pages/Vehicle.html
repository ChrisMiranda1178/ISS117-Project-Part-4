             The Z-95 Headhunter, also referred to as the Z-95 starfighter or simply the Z-95, was a multi-purpose starfighter jointly manufactured by Incom Corporation and Sublights Products Corporation. 
			 Despite being considered outdated, the Z-95 was durable and adaptable to a variety of different roles, which led many to recognize it as a versatile and respectable snub-fighter of its era. 
			 Countless variants of the Headhunter were produced, including one model designed specifically for the Grand Army of the Republic's clone pilots during the Clone Wars. 
			 The Z-95 was the forerunner of Incom's popular T-65B X-wing starfighter.

              The Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I, also known as the Vulture-class droid starfighter, or more simply as the vulture droid, was an unmanned model of droid starfighter manufactured by Haor Chall Engineering Corporation and utilized by 
			  the Trade Federation and later the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The fighter relied on overwhelming numbers during combat. Usually, these droids were constructed in the cathedral factories of Xi Char, 
			  where precision manufacturing was considered an act of religious worship. They were present at many engagements during the Clone Wars.
